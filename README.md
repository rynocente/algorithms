# algorithms

Some algorithms in Java and Javascript :knife: :knife: :black_heart:

- O(N) if there are N data elements, how many steps will the algorithm take?
- Big O Notation ignores constants
- Big O Notation only takes into account the highest order of N when we have multiple orders added together
- Big O focuses primarily on worst-case scenarios
- O(N * M) can be constructed as a range between O(N) and O(N²)
- Looking up a value in a hash table has an efficency of O(1) on average, as it usually takes just one step
- A good hash table strikes a balance of avoiding collisions while not consuming lots of memory
        



O(1)

O(log N)

O(N)

O(N*M)

O(N²)
