# algorithms

Some algorithms in Java and Javascript :knife: :knife: :black_heart:

- O(N) if there are N data elements, how many steps will the algorithm take?
- Big O Notation ignores constants
- Big O Notation only takes into account the highest order of N when we have multiple orders added together




O(1)

O(log N)

O(N)

O(NÂ²)
